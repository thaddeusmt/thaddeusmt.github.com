  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have not blogged very much the last couple of years, but I am feeling the itch again. I love how blogging makes you more closely research and examine your thoughts and your code. I have missed it. I also miss the positive feedback and ego-reinforcement of blog comments and Google Analytics stats. So for 2013 I am trying to get back on the horse.</p>

<p>It was 4 years ago that I first decided to blog about web design and development on my freelance web design site, Chili Pepper Design. I read some high praise for the <a href="http://textpattern.com/">Textpattern</a> PHP content management system, and installed it. It worked well, but had started to feel dated of late. And besides, none of the cool kids on Hacker News ever talk about Textpattern any more. ;)</p>

<p>So what are the cool kids talking about now? What is the new hotness? Ruby-powered static Jekyll blogs of course! Hosted on GitHub Pages! Thus you see before you the new Chili Pepper Design blog, powered by <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> (a fork of <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>).</p>

<p>Actually it&#8217;s not that new or hot anymore, but here are a few reasons why I chose to go the Jekyll/Octopress route regardless:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://octopress.org/docs/setup/">Short learning curve</a></strong> - I was also comtemplating setting up a custom Rails blog, but have not found the time</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com/lessons/jekyll-introduction.html#how_jekyll_generates_the_final_static_files">Static</a></strong> - fast loading! and no database to set up, migrate or maintain</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a></strong> - I am learning Ruby, so this is a good excuse to squint at some code.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> hosting</strong> - free and (fairly) easy to set up</li>
<li><strong>Easy to theme</strong> - not only is the default Octopress rad, but you have total freedom when styling Jekyll blogs</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-party-plugins">Hipster plugins</a></strong> - easily show off your Coderwall and StackOverflow bling, etc</li>
</ul>


<p>Next up I&#8217;m going to stretch out my old blogging muscles with a post about how I migrated my blog from Textpattern to Octopress - on <em>windows</em> (dun dun dun).</p>

<p> Cheers!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, this might be for kind of a narrow audience, but I&#8217;m pretty stoked on it so I wanted to share.</p>
<p>In the newest version of the Magento ecommerce platform, Magento 1.5, they have redone their update script. In <a href="http://www.yireo.com/blog/1294-magento-15-mage-command-line">Magento Connect 2.0</a>, what was called &#8220;pear&#8221; is now &#8220;mage&#8221;.</p>
<p>Old and busted:<br />
<pre><code>./pear mage-setup .</code></pre></p>
<p>New Hotness:<br />
<pre><code>./mage mage-setup .</code></pre></p>
<p>They basically work the same, but the name has changed and &#8211; more importantly if you are reading this &#8211; there is no windows batch file to run. There is a Bash shell script, so you can download and update Magento and it&#8217;s many Extensions via the command line in <em>Linux</em>, but not Windows.</p>
<p>So, looking at the mage.sh script and working from the pear.bat script, I made mage.bat. It lets you do command line downloads and updates of Magento in Windows, just like you can on Linux.</p>
<p>Not that anyone is actually hosting Magento on a <span class="caps">WAMP</span> setup, but I find it useful to be able to download and install Extensions and modules on my Windows development box.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve run into a problem providing my clients good, easy-to-use media embed functionality with the existing JavaScript <span class="caps">WYSIWYG</span> editors. The big players, <a href="http://ckeditor.com/">CKEditor</a> (formery FCKEditor) and <a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/">TinyMCE</a> both provide a &#8220;Flash&#8221; button which works okay with YouTube and other large video providers, but what about embedding a Picasa slideshow? None of the <span class="caps">WYSIWYG</span> editors come with plugin to just insert some <span class="caps">HTML</span> code. If you want to embed something like a Picasa slideshow,  customized YouTube player, or Google Map you have open up the source code, find the location you want to insert it, and paste in the code. Fine for some, but difficult and scary for most as it breaks the <span class="caps">WYSIWYG</span> paradigm.</p>
<p>On one of my latest Drupal websites there are multiple bloggers, none of whom are particularly tech savvy. I set up the <span class="caps">CMS</span> with TinyMCE because I like how they can drag and drop images around (I just wish Drupal had an image embed uploader like WordPress!). After a while they complained that the Insert Flash button in TinyMCE just wasn&#8217;t cutting it. So I set about fixing it. How hard could it be to make a plugin that just inserts some <span class="caps">HTML</span> code where your cursor is? Like it already does for images?</p>
<p>It turns out it is very easy. I was able to just edit the TinyMCE &#8220;Example&#8221; plug-in, which already did basically exactly what I wanted. So here I provide it to you, Internet. I hope it is useful, and please let me know if it&#8217;s broken (or could work better). Thanks!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, I&#8217;ve been working on a simple module for a Drupal project lately. I wanted to have two administrator settings for the module, the second of which depends on the first. A &#8220;dependent dropdown&#8221;. It would be cool if it was &#8220;AJAXy&#8221; too, I thought. Well, it just so turns out that in Drupal 6 there are built in <a href="http://ajax.phpmagazine.net/2005/11/ahah_asychronous_html_and_http.html"><span class="caps">AHAH</span></a> (Asychronous <span class="caps">HTML</span> and <span class="caps">HTTP</span>) functions in the Forms <span class="caps">API</span> to do just this. Easy! Or is it?</p>
<p>It also turns out there is a steep learning curve to making &#8220;Ajax forms&#8221; with the Drupal Forms <span class="caps">API</span>. I got it working, but it took a fair amount of effort. So, to help out future Drupal <span class="caps">AHAH</span> developers I am providing my code below, along with a list of links to resources that were a great help in unraveling this problem.</p>
<p>First, to help provide an &#8220;aerial view&#8221; of what&#8217;s going on here, this is a list of the components involved:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You know, you always read in <span class="caps">SEO</span> articles about how important blogging is for increasing traffic. It&#8217;s one of the top suggestions around for improving a website&#8217;s search engine juice. Well, I am here to testify that it truly is a great <span class="caps">SEO</span> tool.</p>
<p>Granted, the title of this post is hyperbolic link-bait. ;) But it&#8217;s true nonetheless!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had this site, <a href="http://www.chilipepperdesign.com">http://chilipepperdesign.com</a>, up for probably five years now but only as a static portfolio site for most of that time. Then, a year ago, I upgraded the site and added a blog to it.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, this stumped me for a while. I needed my small custom Drupal module to select a bunch of nodes based on a <span class="caps">CCK</span> Date field and the Publish status. It is a pain to query the <span class="caps">CCK</span> tables directly, so every forum post I could find told me to do this via Views. That&#8217;s all well and good, but the instructions for doing this all involved creating a View with the Vuiews UI, <em>then</em> calling it to make my query.</p>
<p>But I wanted to have some of the View&#8217;s query parameters change dynamically based on my module&#8217;s admin settings. Although you could probably do this with some custom Views Argument <span class="caps">PHP</span> code, I didn&#8217;t want to do it this way. It divorced the code from my module too much somehow. It would mean that after I installed my module I would have to create a View and paste in some custom <span class="caps">PHP</span> code! Yuck.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am using the very slick and enjoyable <a href="http://sorgalla.com/projects/jcarousel/">jCarousel</a> plugin for <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> on a new project to display featured content on the front page. I wanted to use the <a href="http://sorgalla.com/projects/jcarousel/examples/static_controls.html">external controls</a> to allow users to easily jump between slides. However, all the examples I found required hard-coding the control links into the document <span class="caps">HTML</span>. This is not best practice because when JavaScript is disabled and the carousel degrades to a simple list you have a bunch of control links that do nothing sitting there on the page. Better to create the controls in JS and append them to the <span class="caps">DOM</span> with jQuery! This way the controls only appear when the jCarousel script is loaded and ready to use them.</p>
<p>To do this I just had to add a little extra code to the <em>initCallback</em> method I was already using to bind the external controls. Here is the JS needed to unobtrusively create a jCarousel with 4 external control links:</p>
